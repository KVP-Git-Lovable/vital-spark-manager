/**
 * A date picker that closes once a date is picked.
 *
 * Every calendar in the app was written out by hand as an uncontrolled
 * `<Popover>` wrapping a `<Calendar>`, and an uncontrolled popover has no way
 * to shut itself: nothing in `onSelect` could close it, so picking a date left
 * the month grid sitting over the page until you clicked elsewhere. Twelve of
 * the thirteen behaved that way. The clinic reported it on the reports filter.
 *
 * Holding the open state is the whole fix, and holding it in one place is what
 * stops the next date picker being written with the same gap.
 *
 * The markup is deliberately the same as the hand-written blocks it replaces -
 * same Popover, same `w-auto p-0` content, same calendar classes - so this
 * changes when the calendar closes and nothing about how it looks.
