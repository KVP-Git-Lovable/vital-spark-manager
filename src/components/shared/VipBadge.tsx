/**
 * The mark that says the front desk should recognise this patient.
 *
 * Deliberately not the engagement tier sitting next to it on the patient page.
 * That one is computed from visits and spend and answers "how much has this
 * patient been worth"; this one is a judgement somebody made on purpose, and a
 * doctor's mother is VIP on her first visit and will never be Platinum. Gold
 * and a crown, so the two never read as the same thing.
 *
 * One component, used on the patient header, the appointment list, the calendar
 * block and the appointment sheet, so the mark cannot come to mean different
 * things on different screens.
 *
 * `shimmer` is for the one-of-a-kind surfaces - a patient header, an open
 * appointment - never for a list. Fifty animated pills in a day's appointments
 * is fifty compositor layers on a clinic PC, and the still badge is already the
 * only gold thing on the row.
