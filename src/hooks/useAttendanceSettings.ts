 * The attendance settings, for whoever needs them.

 * Everything here is readable by any signed-in user and writable only by an
 * admin - a staff member has to know whether a selfie is required before
 * they can check in, they just cannot change the answer.
 *
 * Falls back to DEFAULT_ATTENDANCE_CONFIG while the row is loading rather
 * than rendering a half-configured page: the defaults are the same values
 * the migration seeds, so nothing changes under somebody mid-check-in.
 *
 * `as never` on the table names: these three tables arrived in migration
 * 20261103120000 and the generated Supabase types are regenerated on sync,
 * so until then the tables are real and the types do not know them.
