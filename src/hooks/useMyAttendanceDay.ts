/**
 * One person's working day: the state of it, and the two acts that change it.
 *
 * This lives in a hook because the clinic asked for the same two buttons on
 * the dashboard as well as on /attendance - walking to Employees > Attendance
 * to press Start My Day was a detour at nine in the morning. The obvious way
 * to add them would be a second, simpler check-in on the dashboard, and that
 * is exactly the trap: the face check, the retry count, the location capture,
 * the photo stamp, the bypass-on-service-failure rule and the
 * register-your-face-then-carry-on detour would all have to be duplicated,
 * and the copies would drift. The reference app has three copies of its
 * week-off rule and they disagree; this is the same mistake one layer up.
 *
 * So both surfaces call this, and both render the SAME CameraDialog props.
 * They differ only in how they draw the result.
 *
 * Because both use the same react-query key, starting the day on the
 * dashboard updates the attendance page without either knowing about the
 * other.
