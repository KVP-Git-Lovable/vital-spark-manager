/**
 * What is narrowing the appointments list, in words.
 *
 * The list restores its filters from the browser on every load - the doctor,
 * the status, the visit status and the date - and the panel they live in is
 * closed by default. So a filter set once, weeks ago, goes on narrowing every
 * visit with nothing on screen saying so. "Todays Appointments" read 0 items
 * over a day with 43 appointments in it, and looked like a data fault.
 *
 * The page already carries a note about the same disease in a different organ:
 * the list used to open filtered to the current week "with nothing on screen
 * saying so", which "looked like a data or permissions fault and was neither".
 * This is the sentence that was missing.
