 * Whose name goes on an appointment.
 *
 * An appointment stores the patient twice: `patient_id`, the link to the record,
 * and `patient_name`, a text copy written when it was booked. Nineteen screens
 * each decided for themselves which to show and they did not agree - the list
 * showed the copy, the detail page showed the record, and one list row managed
 * to show both at once, the patient's photo and initials from the record beside
 * text from the copy.
 *
 * A family of four sharing one phone number is all it took for that to become
 * visible: a booking for the fifth session of Baazi's course was filed under her
 * sister Saher's name, so the list read Saher and the page behind it read Baazi.
 *
 * The linked record wins. That is the record the clinic prescribes on,
 * photographs, bills and counts visits against, so it is the name that has to be
 * on screen. The stored copy answers only where a screen fetched appointments
 * without the patient join - global search, staff detail, the photo picker, the
 * appointments report - and a trigger now keeps it in step with the record.
