/**
 * Focusing the in-app camera on the spot somebody tapped.
 *
 * The clinic photographs skin, and tapping the viewfinder did nothing at all.
 * Where the browser allows it, a tap can now aim the camera's focus at that
 * point - the same gesture every phone camera app has.
 *
 * WHERE IT WILL NOT WORK, because it matters more than where it will:
 * Safari on iOS exposes no focus control to a web page whatsoever. No
 * focusMode, no pointsOfInterest, nothing. On an iPhone - which is most of
 * this clinic - supportsTapFocus() is false and no constraint written here
 * will ever reach the lens. That is Apple's decision, not a gap to code
 * around; the caller falls back to re-running the camera's own autofocus and
 * points at the phone's own camera, which does focus.
 *
 * None of this touches a browser, so it is all testable from plain values -
 * which matters because the one thing that silently ruins tap-to-focus is
 * getting the coordinates the wrong way round and focusing on the opposite
 * corner.
