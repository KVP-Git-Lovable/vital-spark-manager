 * A therapist signing in landed on the clinic's whole day - 39 appointments,
 * every doctor's name, the NPS score, the pending invoices - because in 805
 * lines of Index.tsx nothing ever asked who was looking. The only
 * role-derived value in the file was canSeeBilling, which hides money and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The two conventions below are the ones that matter. Breaking either does
 * not show somebody too much; it locks real people out of their own clinic.
