/**
 * Recovering what an edge function actually said.
 *
 * supabase-js reports any non-2xx from an edge function as a FunctionsHttpError
 * whose message is the generic "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code",
 * and sets `data` to null. So the usual
 *
 *   if (error) throw error;
 *   if (data?.error) throw new Error(data.error);
 *
 * never reaches the second line, and the reason the function returned - which
 * it did send, as { error: "..." } - is thrown away. The operator gets a red
 * toast that says nothing they can act on.
 *
 * That cost real time: three doctors could not be given logins because
 * create-user-account was failing, and the only signal was that generic string.
