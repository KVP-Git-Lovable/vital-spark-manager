/**
 * Invoice numbers continue the clinic's Salesforce series: Salesforce ended at
 * B-49053, so the first bill raised in this app is INV-49054 and it counts on
 * from there.
 *
 * They are allocated by the database, not here. Every number used to come from
 * `Date.now().toString().slice(-6)` in the browser - the millisecond clock mod
 * a million, which wraps every 16 minutes 40 seconds, so the same number came
 * round several times a day and two people billing at once could be handed the
 * same one. That is no basis for a series the clinic has to show an auditor.
 *
 * `next_invoice_numbers(n)` draws from a Postgres sequence, so numbers are
 * unique and increasing however many people are billing at the same time, and
 * a unique index on invoices.invoice_number refuses a duplicate outright.
 *
 * Call this when the bill is SAVED, never when the form opens: a number handed
 * out is spent, and abandoning a half-filled dialog should not leave a hole in
 * the series.
