/**
 * The three things Invoices & Revenue needs that an invoice row does not carry:
 * what was billed, at what material percentage, and how much that deducts.
 *
 * Material cost used to be a report of its own. It is on the invoice report now,
 * and the arithmetic deliberately did not move with it: `material_cost_lines`
 * already decides which percentage wins - the one on the billed line, then the
 * one typed on the visit, then the Service Master - and that order exists so
 * correcting the master later does not rewrite what a past visit cost.
 * Re-deriving any of it here would let two reports of the same money disagree.
 *
 * The view holds one row per billed service line; this report holds one row per
 * invoice. So these fold the lines onto their invoice, and nothing else about
 * the row changes - the total, the GST and the collection cards are the same
 * figures they were before material cost arrived beside them.
