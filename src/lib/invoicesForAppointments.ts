/**
 * Invoices for a known set of appointments, looked up by id.
 *
 * The Appointments page used to build its bill/payment-mode lookup by pulling
 * the ENTIRE invoices table through fetchAll(). That had three problems:
 *
 *   - it had no ORDER BY, and PostgREST .range() paging without one is not
 *     stable, so rows could be silently skipped or repeated across pages;
 *   - it grew with the clinic's whole billing history rather than with what is
 *     on screen, so a later page could hit the statement timeout - and a
 *     throwing query leaves useQuery's data at [], which renders as a dash in
 *     every Bill Amount and Payment Mode cell with nothing to say why;
 *   - it was slow even when it worked, for a screen showing twenty rows.
 *
 * Fetching by appointment id instead keeps the work proportional to the rows
 * being displayed. The ids go in the URL, so they are chunked well below any
 * URL-length limit, and the chunks run a few at a time to stay quick on the
 * wide date ranges.

 * not the reports, not the invoice roll-up.
 *
 * And a visit can carry **more than one** live bill: 883 of them do, the
 * consultation billed apart from the treatment. Overwriting meant Shruthi's
 * 12 September visit read ₹1,250 or ₹18,000 depending on the order the rows
 * arrived, for a visit billed ₹19,250. They are kept together now, and the
 * clinic asked to see both.
 *
 * The value is still one object, so every caller keeps working: the totals are
 * what sorting, filtering and export read, and `bills` is what the cell shows.
