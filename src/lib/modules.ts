/**
 * Every module a role's permissions can be set for.
 *
 * This list used to live inside UserManagement.tsx, which meant the only thing
 * that could read it was the page that edits it. The sidebar needs the same
 * list to decide what to show, and the route guard needs the same keys, so it
 * moved here rather than being copied.
 *
 * ── Two things about this list are load-bearing ──
 *
 * 1. `savePerms` in User Management DELETES every row for a role and reinserts
 *    one row per entry here. A key that is removed from this list is therefore
 *    deleted from the database the next time anybody presses Save on any role.
 *    Removing an entry is a data change, not a tidy-up.
 *
 * 2. A key added here has no row on any existing role until a migration
 *    back-fills one, and `?? false` in the reader means "no row" reads as
 *    denied. So adding a key is always a pair: this list, and a migration.
 *
 * The keys are also what `ProtectedRoute moduleKey="..."` passes in src/App.tsx
 * and what the menu entries carry in AppSidebar.tsx. All three have to agree,
 * which is what src/lib/rolePermissions.test.ts checks.
