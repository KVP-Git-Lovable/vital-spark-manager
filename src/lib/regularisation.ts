/**
 * Asking for a forgotten punch to be put right.
 *
 * Somebody forgets to press End My Day. The record sits open for ever, the
 * month's hours are short, and until now there was no way to ask for it to
 * be fixed and no screen for an admin to fix it from - the only correction
 * in this repo's history was made by hand in SQL.
 *
 * The decisions live here rather than in the form so they can be tested
 * without a database, and so the same answer is given whether the request
 * comes from the dialog, a keyboard-pasted date or a future paste of this
 * code somewhere else. The database carries the same three rules as CHECK
 * constraints, which is what makes them true rather than merely asked for.
