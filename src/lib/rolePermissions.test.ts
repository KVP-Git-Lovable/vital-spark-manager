/**
 * What each role may see, and the four places that have to agree about it.
 *
 * Therapists and nurses are getting their own logins. Before this, the menu
 * showed everybody all 47 pages - AppSidebar's canView() was `return true`
 * with a note saying "for now" - while the route guard refused most of them.
 * A menu that disagrees with the guard is worse than no gating: it sends
 * people to Access Denied and teaches them the app is broken.
 *
 * So the module key now lives in exactly one list, and these tests hold the
 * four readers of it together: the registry, the route table, the menu and
 * the migration that fills in the rows. Any one of them drifting is silent
 * in production and loud here.
