 * The quick-date chip a saved view implies, so the two date filters agree.

 * The Appointments list has two of them. The chip row decides what is FETCHED
 * from the server; a view's own conditions then narrow that result client-side.
 * When they disagree the chip wins, quietly - a view whose date condition is
 * wider than the chip loses rows the server never asked for. Reading the chip
 * off the view removes the disagreement.
 *
 * The two vocabularies were already almost the same: dateRangeFor() in
 * listViews/engine.ts uses the same operator keys as the chip presets.
