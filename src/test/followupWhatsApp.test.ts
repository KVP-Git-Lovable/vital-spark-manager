 * Meta templates on 10 Nov 2026; the buttons open WhatsApp directly now. These
 * tests are kept because the function is kept, and because followupSend.test.ts
 * holds the wording here against the wording that actually goes out - so the
 * two cannot drift apart while this path sleeps.
 *
 * Edge functions are outside the app's tsconfig and there is no Deno here, so
 * the pure helpers carry the coverage - the same arrangement
 * googleReviewSend.test.ts uses for the review sender.
