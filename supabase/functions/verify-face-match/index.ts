/**
 * Does the attendance selfie show the same person as their profile photo?
 *
 * Ported from the Bharath Builders app (APK99-dot/field-force-friendly,
 * read-only reference), with its prompt and threshold kept, and two things
 * changed for this clinic:
 *
 *  - It is gated on a signed-in caller, as knowledge-ai is. The reference's
 *    version answers anybody who can reach the URL, which would let someone
 *    feed it two arbitrary images all day on the clinic's AI budget.
 *  - It answers only about the CALLER's own staff photo. The client passes
 *    nothing but the selfie's path; the baseline is looked up server-side, so
 *    a caller cannot ask "does this selfie match THAT person" by swapping a
 *    URL - which is how a face check gets turned into a face search.
 *
 * The threshold is applied here, not taken from the model's own `matched`
 * field, so a chatty answer cannot talk its way to a pass.

- Compare: distance between eyes, eye shape, nose width and bridge, lip shape, jawline, ear shape, forehead height, cheekbone structure, chin shape.
- Two DIFFERENT people of the same gender, age range, ethnicity, or with similar hairstyles, glasses or skin tone MUST score below 40. Surface similarity is NOT a match.
- If either image is blurry, dark, partly covered, shows no clear face, shows several faces, or shows the back or side of a head, return confidence 0 and matched false.
- If you have ANY doubt they might be different people, return below ${CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD}.
- A FALSE POSITIVE lets one employee mark another present. That is far worse than a false negative, which only asks someone to retake a photo.
